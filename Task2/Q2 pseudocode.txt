PROBLEM 2:
Function Main
    Declare Integer a, b, i, n, next
    
    Output "This is a program to calculate and print the first m Fibonacci numbers"
    Output "Enter the number of terms you would like to display"
    Input n
    Assign i = 0
    Assign a = 0
    Assign b = 1
    While i<n
        If i<=1
            Assign next = i
        False:
            Assign next = a+b
            Assign a = b
            Assign b = next
        End
        Output next
        Assign i = i+1
    End
End
